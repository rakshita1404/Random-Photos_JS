Your infinite scroll IS working
❌ But it's loading images too many times (triggering repeatedly)
The Problem:
When you scroll near the bottom, the scroll event fires many times per second, so addNewImages() gets called over and over, creating too many images at once.

Solution is adding a flag 

This will prevent the function from being called multiple times in quick succession. Now it will load once, wait 1 second, then allow loading again when you scroll further.
You can remove the console.log statements now since you know it's working!

Real-World Analogy:
Think of it like a door lock:

🔓 isLoading = false → Door unlocked, you can enter
🔒 isLoading = true → Door locked, you must wait
⏰ After 1 second → Door unlocks automatically

setTimeout(() => {
    isLoading = false; // ← Reset flag back to false
}, 1000);
```
- Flag is reset to `false`
- Now the user can trigger loading again if they scroll more

## Visual Timeline:
```
Time: 0s
isLoading = false
User scrolls → Load images! → isLoading = true

Time: 0.1s
User still scrolling → Check isLoading → true → Don't load!

Time: 0.2s
User still scrolling → Check isLoading → true → Don't load!

Time: 0.5s
User still scrolling → Check isLoading → true → Don't load!

Time: 1.0s
setTimeout triggers → isLoading = false

Time: 1.5s
User scrolls more → Check isLoading → false → Load images! → isLoading = true

At 100% zoom, all the images fit on your screen, but at 110% zoom they're bigger so the page becomes scrollable. This confirms the issue.

These lines run as soon as the page loads (not waiting for any event). They call addNewImages() twice:

First call: adds 10 images
Second call: adds 10 more images
Total: 20 images loaded immediately

This guarantees your page will be tall enough to scroll, so the infinite scroll feature will work at 100% zoom.
Solution: 3 HTML images + 20 loaded images = 23 total images, definitely scrollable!
