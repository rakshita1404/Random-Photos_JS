if (window.scrollY + window.innerHeight >= document.documentElement.scrollHeight - 100)
```

**The three main parts:**

1. **`window.scrollY`** 
   - The number of pixels the page has been scrolled from the top
   - If you haven't scrolled, it's 0
   - If you've scrolled down 500px, it's 500

2. **`window.innerHeight`**
   - The height of the browser viewport (the visible area)
   - If your browser window is 800px tall, this is 800

3. **`document.documentElement.scrollHeight`**
   - The total height of the entire document (including the parts you can't see)
   - If your page is 3000px tall total, this is 3000

**The logic:**
```
window.scrollY + window.innerHeight
```
This gives you the **bottom position of the viewport** (how far you've scrolled + the visible area height)
```
document.documentElement.scrollHeight - 100
```
This is the **total page height minus 100px** (a buffer zone)

**Visual example:**
```
Total page height: 3000px (scrollHeight)
Viewport height: 800px (innerHeight)
Current scroll position: 2100px (scrollY)

Bottom of viewport = 2100 + 800 = 2900px
Trigger point = 3000 - 100 = 2900px

2900 >= 2900 → TRUE! Load more images

The 100 is actually arbitrary - it's just a buffer value that works well in most cases. There's nothing special about 100 specifically.
What it does:

It triggers the loading 100 pixels before the user reaches the absolute bottom
This creates a smoother experience because images start loading while the user is still scrolling
